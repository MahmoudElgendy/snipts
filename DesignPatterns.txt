golden tip favor composition over inheritance 
Decorator
----------
add additional behavior to the object (Rapper design pattern)
if we use inhertance insteed it will end up with inhertance explosion and each new class can only do on feacher if you want add more than one feature inherit new class
so that is not maintainable approach
