if data changes frequently => linked List
tasks waiting to be processed => stack queue
Enumerate Data=> means you want to access all the items in a collection (foreach)

foreach(var item in items){}
items called=> iteration variable

in c#8 or newer and dotnet core
arr.length -1 = ^1 in general ^n means length -n

how to embeded variable inside string $"myname is {name}"

predicate => a set of instructions to insure if a variable satisfy some conditions

array => length
any other collection => count

in breaf
use list if you want to add and delete and when you don't know number of items when initialization
user array if you  dont want to add and delete
list internally use array so add and delete may be slow because it need to copy elemnts to new array.

best use for lists
once create it and pop up with data numeration operation and replaceing without increase size operations
supperfat for look up 
not good choice for frequently add and delete

Dictionaries (hash tables) to facilitate lookups without index

array and list => designed for indexbase lookup and enumerating
dictionary=>designed for findig elements

Dictionary => not sorted -  use it unless you realy need sorting
SortedDictionary=>Automatically sort by key  - key must be type that can be sort int or string
SortedList(it is a dictionary not a list as same as SortedDictionary but different in performance)  most of situations you are not gonna need it u just need it if you sorted the elements already before initiate the sortedlist

sets and hash sets
 very useful when you want to compine differnt collections together.
 
 hash set dealing with collection as a whole
 
 multidimentinal array => one array with more than one index
 Jagged array => array of arrays

stack and queue =>Taskes to be processed  (frequent add and remove)
add=enque=push  remove = deque = pop
queue => web page requests, customers to be served ,task to be done 
stack => undo, call stack,debugging , full bus

linked list => optimized for frequent add and remove but caller should decide whick item to remmove
remember it is not a list it is a kind of chain
whay add and remove is so fast be cause you dont need to shift any items
