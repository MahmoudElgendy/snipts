angular js => web framework(lemetited to code) mvc.
andgular => platform(related to all software life cycle) component.

Anatomy:-
 Modules
 Component
 Directives
 Services
 Pipes
 Routing
 
 Modules => group set of elements in application in one single unit  
            application may have more than one module but at least one(represent the initial component of the app)
            aclass with ngModule dicorator
 component => a class with @Componet   directive
              peace of ui with data and logic
              Eent Bindings - property bindigs
              
 Directives => away to transform elements of Html 
              component ->
              structural -> alter the dom (ng if , ing for)
              attribute-> cnange appearance of behavior of  existing elements
              
Pieps => transform data frm one form to antother      

Services => to share data and logic not only related to  specifically component.

routing=> for navigation
 
horizontal scaling=> add more servers to process information.
vertical scale improve the characteristics of existing servers.(add more ram) 
 
 installation steps
1-  while installing node download the recommending version (last stable vertion)
2- install angular  npm i -g @angular/cli
3- if you want to upgrad your .ne go for dot net and download SDk(not runtime) then run it
for vs code (some extenions)=> Angular Language,c#
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef => helps you to use entityframework form command line
better to have both frontend and back separated so you  can deploy them separatly.

node_modules => the folder contains all applications

ctr+ , => opens the settings then type exclude to exclude any type of files you need

How angular bootstrapped an application?

1- Angular.json=>important info about environment and settings and lunching and bootstrapping
2- in this file udner bulid seciton there are main which determine the starup file (main.ts)
3- main.ts inside platformBrowserDynamic.bootstrapModule(... there are the main modlule to start....)
4- inside the defalut app(AppModule) inside NgModule directive >bootstrap >the name of first componet to run.
5- inside this component use the selector to use it in the index page the single page of the application

for pieps u can chain more than one 

  title = this._title.setTitle( 'angular-movies | ');
  
  oninit() code inside it execute right after instantiate the component
  
 -- passing data from parent to child (make your component reusable)
  suppose u need to display 2 lists of movies one for curren and second for upcomming
  put data in parent component and pass diffrent list for each child
  
  <app-movies-list [movies]="upcommingMovies"></app-movies-list>
  <h4>upcomming</h4>
  <app-movies-list [movies]="movies"></app-movies-list>
  
  passing parameters to parent (react to the user input)
