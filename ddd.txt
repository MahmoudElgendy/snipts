Clean Architecture: Patterns, Practices, and Principles
-------------------------------------------------------
focus on what is trully essential to the software archetict varsus what is just implementation detail
inhabitants means => users, developers build , and developers maintain
build only what is necessary only when it is necessary
cosist of 7 projects
Presentation => controllers or end points
Application=> abstractions corresponding to the application(use cases)
Domain=> abstractions corresponding to the problem domain
persistance=>databse
infrastructure=>third part dependances
common=>cross cutting concerns
speceficatoins=> acceptance test
-----------------------------------------
Domain Centric Architecture


1- database centric
db(data access)=>Business Logic=>UI

2- domain centric
domain=>application=>persistance,infrastructure,Presentatioin

the first concern of the architect is to make sure that house is usable, it is not to insure that the house is made of brick.

essential VS implementation Details

hexagonal - onion  - clean

-------------------------------------
Application Layer
Implement  use cases
High level application logic
knows about the domain
know knowledge about other layers
contains interfaces
