angular js => web framework(lemetited to code) mvc.
andgular => platform(related to all software life cycle) component.

Anatomy:-
 Modules
 Component
 Directives
 Services
 Pipes
 Routing
 
 Modules => group set of elements in application in one single unit  
            application may have more than one module but at least one(represent the initial component of the app)
            aclass with ngModule dicorator
 component => a class with @Componet   directive
              peace of ui with data and logic
              Eent Bindings - property bindigs
              
 Directives => away to transform elements of Html 
              component ->
              structural -> alter the dom (ng if , ing for)
              attribute-> cnange appearance of behavior of  existing elements
              
Pieps => transform data frm one form to antother      

Services => to share data and logic not only related to  specifically component.

routing=> for navigation
 
horizontal scaling=> add more servers to process information.
vertical scale improve the characteristics of existing servers.(add more ram) 
 
 installation steps
1-  while installing node download the recommending version (last stable vertion)
2- install angular  npm i -g @angular/cli
3- if you want to upgrad your .ne go for dot net and download SDk(not runtime) then run it
for vs code (some extenions)=> Angular Language,c#
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef => helps you to use entityframework form command line
better to have both frontend and back separated so you  can deploy them separatly.

node_modules => the folder contains all applications

ctr+ , => opens the settings then type exclude to exclude any type of files you need

How angular bootstrapped an application?

1- Angular.json=>important info about environment and settings and lunching and bootstrapping
2- in this file udner bulid seciton there are main which determine the starup file (main.ts)
3- main.ts inside platformBrowserDynamic.bootstrapModule(... there are the main modlule to start....)
4- inside the defalut app(AppModule) inside NgModule directive >bootstrap >the name of first componet to run.
5- inside this component use the selector to use it in the index page the single page of the application

for pieps u can chain more than one 

  title = this._title.setTitle( 'angular-movies | ');
  
  oninit() code inside it execute right after instantiate the component
  
 -- passing data from parent to child (make your component reusable)
  suppose u need to display 2 lists of movies one for curren and second for upcomming
  put data in parent component and pass diffrent list for each child
  
  <app-movies-list [movies]="upcommingMovies"></app-movies-list>
  <h4>upcomming</h4>
  <app-movies-list [movies]="movies"></app-movies-list>
  
  passing parameters to parent (react to the user input)
  
ng group => used to group a set of element.
we cann't use ngif and ngfor in same div tag because we cant but 2 structural directives in same tag
so you shoul to nest for inside if but u have to reaplace rapper div with ng-container to keep style
- can you declare variable inside html not ts??
-- yes by useing Template variable or decorator (will be discussed later)
- how?
--set #variable name in any input dom element to make it template variable u can then use it.
can we pass html content as a paramenter (not value all component)?
yes by useing content projection

ng-content && ng-container
angular material => library contains many componets
to install it  ng add @angualr/material
notice that :-
angular material is huge library u may not use all so
u can generate module for it here u add all angular material modules u need then import this module into ur app module
ngclass help me to add css dynamically
lifecycle of a component => the different stages componet goes through we can execute functions in each of thes stages (hocks)
onInit()
onChanges()=> fires when parameters of  the componet are updated from the outside(some times may fire before onInit())
onDestrou()=>just before componet is destroyed
DoCheck()=>each time the change detectore gets executed by angular
afterVeiwInit()=>when content of component had been rendered(subscrip to chages to property decorated with viewchild decorator
afterViewChecked
afterContentInit
aftercontentChecked
-------
global styling:-
applyed for all components (style.css)

event Binding => (click)="remove(index)
property Binding => [movies]="currentMovies"

any change in the module need rerun.
